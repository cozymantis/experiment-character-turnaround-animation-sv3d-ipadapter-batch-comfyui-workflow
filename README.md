## Steps

- Generate a 1024x1024 reference image with 2 general passes and a face detailing pass;

- Run it through [SV3D](https://sv3d.github.io/) to get a 576x576 turnaround;

- Run the frames through the [IPAdapter Tiled Batch](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus) node;

- Upscale each frame to 1024x1024 using different values for denoise and the batch IPAdapter output models.

## Nodes You Need To Install

This workflow depends on a few other great custom nodes that you should install first. The recommended path is to use ComfyUI Manager's "Install missing nodes" feature - see https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.

- Open the ComfyUI Manager Menu
- Click on the "Install Missing Custom Nodes" button
- Restart ComfyUI and refresh the web app

Alternatively, for manual installs, here is the list of required custom nodes and packs:

- Our Cozy Utils pack (https://github.com/cozymantis/cozy-utils-comfyui-nodes)
- Our Cozy Pose Face&Body Generator node (https://cozymantis.gumroad.com/l/cozy-pose-face-body-openpose-generator-comfyui-node-character-reference)
- Impact Pack (https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)
- IPAdapter Plus (https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus)
  - FaceID requires insightface, you need to install it in your ComfyUI environment. Run `pip install insightface` inside your ComfyUI python env, or try the "Install pip package" options in the ComfyUI Manager menu. Check [this issue](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus/issues/162) for help.
  - Check the IPAdapter installation instructions in the repo above.
- WAS Node Suite (https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui)
- Image Resize for ComfyUI (https://github.com/palant/image-resize-comfyui)
- ComfyUI's ControlNet Auxiliary Preprocessors (https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux)
- rgthree (https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy)
- ComfyUI Essentials (https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)
- ComfyUI Logic (https://github.com/theUpsider/ComfyUI-Logic)
- FizzNodes (https://github.com/FizzleDorf/ComfyUI_FizzNodes)
